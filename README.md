# sql-challenge

My task is to peform Data Modeling and Data Engineering to conduct a research project on employees of Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data to perform Data Analysis.
